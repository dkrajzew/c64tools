# c64tools

__c64tools__ is [Python](https://www.python.org/) library that helps in dealing with Commodore c64 graphics and memory.

You may find more information at http://www.krajzewicz.de/docs/c64tools/index.html.

The major module is named “[c64tools.py](http://www.krajzewicz.de/docs/c64tools/api_c64tools.html)”. It contains classes that represent major c64 artifacts — memory, bitmap, char, screen, etc. These classes usually support loading, drawing, and being extracted from a pygame surface.

In addition, you may find some applications which use this module:

* a [charpacker](http://www.krajzewicz.de/docs/c64tools/use_charpacker.html)
* a [c64 memory dump to png renderer](http://www.krajzewicz.de/docs/c64tools/use_mem2png.html)
* a [charset from memory dump extractor](http://www.krajzewicz.de/docs/c64tools/use_charset2png.html)
* a [linking tool](http://www.krajzewicz.de/docs/c64tools/use_filemerge.html)

Let me know if you need any further information or advice. I am not actively developing __c64tools__ currently.
